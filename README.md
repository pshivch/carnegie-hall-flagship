# 🎼 Carnegie Hall Flagship

**Flagship design system and AI collaboration hub — the single source of truth for UI, core logic, and orchestration across mirrors.**

This repo is the **command center** for the orchestration portfolio. It harmonizes design standards, ML/CV/RPA collaboration, and governance so every “mirror” repo (Beethoven AI, Disney, Warner Bros., Sony, NBCU, Paramount, Netflix, Apple, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, NASA) plays in time and in tune.

---

## 🌟 Overview
The flagship provides the **governance backbone** for all mirrors. It applies:
- 🎨 **Design System:** unified UI/UX + reusable orchestration components  
- 🧠 **Core Logic:** standardized orchestration workflows and helpers  
- 🤝 **Collaboration Hub:** bridges technical (ML/CV/RPA) + artistic repos  
- ✅ **Integrity:** linting, tests, CI policies to keep quality high  
- 📈 **Metrics & Dashboards:** health, motifs, and orchestration heatmaps

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (anchor)
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, R  
- **Frameworks:** React, SwiftUI, TensorFlow/PyTorch (as needed)  
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions, simple RPA jobs  
- **Governance:** Pre-commit hooks, unit tests, CODEOWNERS, PR templates

---

## 📦 Repo Structure (proposed)
```
/design-system/      # shared UI + orchestration components
/core-logic/         # reusable pipelines, helpers, adapters
/governance/         # CODE_OF_CONDUCT, policies, templates
/dashboards/         # metrics, heatmaps, status boards
/examples/           # minimal examples for mirror repos
```

---

## 🔗 Role in the Ecosystem
- Links and coordinates all mirrors  
- Ships **templates & pipelines** they can copy/paste  
- Keeps each mirror anchored to **one of the five Carnegie Hall pillars**  
- Maintains rules of **scale, orchestration, and governance**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
> This repo is a hub, so mirrors import/clone pieces from here.

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/pshivch/carnegie-hall-flagship.git
cd carnegie-hall-flagship

# (optional) install dev tooling for linting/tests
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# npm ci
```

---

## 📊 Features
- Reusable UI kit for orchestration views  
- Orchestration adapters for ML/CV/RPA pipelines  
- Health & governance dashboards (heatmaps, checks, status)  
- Auto-policies via GitHub Actions (lint, test, badge)

---

## 🧭 Governance & Standards
- **CODEOWNERS** for reviews  
- **Conventional commits** (feat/fix/docs/chore)  
- **PR template** with checklist (tests, docs updated)  
- **Licensing:** MIT (permissive for mirrors)

---

## 🗺 Roadmap
- [ ] Add orchestration heatmaps & project health badge  
- [ ] Publish mirror templates (Disney/Warner/etc.)  
- [ ] Auto-sync script for mirrors to pull flagship updates  
- [ ] Docs site (Getting Started + APIs) via GitHub Pages

---

## 🎻 Inspiration
Carnegie Hall symbolizes bringing **diverse artists under one roof**.  
This flagship does the same for **creative + engineering orchestration**.
