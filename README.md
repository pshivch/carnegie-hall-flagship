## Role in the Ecosystem
This flagship is the **command center**:  
- Links mirror projects (Beethoven AI, Disney, Warner Bros., Sony, NASA, etc.)  
- Provides **templates and pipelines** reused across mirrors  
- Ensures each mirror repo is **anchored to one of the five Carnegie Hall pillars**  
- Maintains rules of **scale, orchestration, and governance**
